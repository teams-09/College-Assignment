_Efficiently managing and accessing data is critical for any software project. Enter the world of multi-key file organization, a technique designed to streamline data storage and retrieval by utilizing multiple keys for each entry._<br>
**Why Multi-Key File Organization?**
* Traditional file organization methods often rely on a single key for indexing, leading to limitations in search capabilities and performance.
* Flexibility: Multi-key organization provides flexibility in querying and sorting data.
* Indexing: Multi-key organization often involves indexing multiple attributes or fields of data, which can improve search performance significantly.
* Optimized Performance: Depending on the specific access patterns and queries, multi-key organization can lead to optimized performance compared to single-key structures
* Complex Relationships: In systems where data entities have complex relationships, multi-key organization can simplify querying and navigation through these relationships by providing multiple access points to the data.<br>
**goal of multi key file organization**
  * Optimized Performance: Ensure optimized performance for both read and write operations, minimizing access time and maximizing throughput.
  * Scalability: Scale seamlessly with growing data volumes and changing access patterns without sacrificing performance.
  * Reduced Redundancy: Minimize redundancy in data storage by efficiently managing multiple keys within the same file structure.
  * Support for Complex Queries: Enable support for complex queries involving multiple criteria or conditions for data retrieval.
  * Efficient Retrieval: Organize data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval based on multiple keys or criteria.
